# Object oriented programming
## Why learn Object Oriented Programming?
- You will program faster. Having a previous analysis of what you are doing will help you to generate code much faster.
- You will be able to answer questions such as What is Encapsulation, What is Abstraction, What is Inheritance, What is Polymorphism in future job interviews?
- Stop copying and pasting code.

## Structured programming
Object Oriented programming is born from the problems created by structured programming and helps us to solve certain problems such as:
- Very long code: As a system grows and becomes more robust the generated code becomes very long making it difficult to read, debug, maintain.
- If something fails, everything breaks: Since with structured programming the code is executed sequentially, if one of those lines fails, everything else stops working.
- Difficult to maintain.


Object Oriented Programming comes from a philosophy or way of thinking that is Object Oriented and this arises from the problems that we need to translate into code.
It is to analyze a problem in the form of objects and then take it to code, that is Object Oriented.
A paradigm is a theory that provides the basis and model for solving problems. The Object Oriented Programming paradigm is composed of 4 elements:
Classes
Properties
Methods
Objects

**And 4 Pillars:**
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism

## Oriented programming languages:
Java:
- Naturally Object Oriented
- It is very useful in Android
- And it is used on the server side or Server Side.
PHP
- Interpreted language
- Intended for the Web
Python
- Designed to be easy to use
- Multiple uses: Web, Server Side, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc.
Javascript
- Interpreted language
- Object Oriented but based on prototypes
- Designed for the Web
C#
Ruby
Kotlin

## Modeling Diagrams
**OMT**: Object Modeling Techniques. It is a methodology for object-oriented analysis.
### UML
UML: Unified Modeling Language. It took the bases and techniques of OMT unifying them. We have more options of diagrams such as Classes, Use Cases, Objects, Activities, Iteration, States, Implementation.
